# Ecommerce Sales Performance Dashboard – Excel Analytics Project
## Project Overview
I developed an interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer segments, regional markets, and product category trends.
The dashboard converts raw transactional data into structured KPIs and visual insights to support business decision-making.

## Business Objective
The purpose of this project is to help stakeholders:
- Monitor overall sales and profit performance
- Identify top and underperforming product categories
- Analyze customer segment contribution
- Track regional market performance
- Observe monthly sales trends and seasonality

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/MounikaPeddapoondra/Ecommerce-Sales-Dashboard-Excel/blob/main/Ecommerce%20sales%20data.xlsx">Ecommerce sales Data</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

What are the total sales, total profit, total number of orders, and overall profit margin?

How do sales change month by month, and are there any seasonal trends?

Which regions generate the highest and lowest revenue?

Which countries contribute most to overall sales?

Which customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) drives the most revenue?

What are the top-performing product categories?

Which product categories are underperforming and need improvement?

How do different shipping modes impact order distribution?

What is the status of orders (completed, cancelled, pending, etc.)?

Where should the business focus to improve sales, profit, and market growth?

## Project Process

Understood the business requirement to analyze ecommerce sales performance across revenue, profit, customers, regions, and product categories.

Collected and reviewed the sales dataset containing order details, customer segments, regions, shipping modes, and financial metrics.

Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting formats, and standardizing fields such as dates, sales, profit, and categories.

Prepared the dataset for analysis by organizing it into a structured format and creating calculated fields like profit margin.

Performed data analysis using Pivot Tables to compute total sales, total profit, total orders, regional sales, customer segment performance, product category sales, and monthly trends.

Developed key KPIs using Excel formulas to provide a quick summary of business performance.

Designed a structured and business-focused dashboard layout with KPI cards and visual comparisons.

Added interactivity using slicers and timeline filters for date, customer segment, shipping mode, and order status.

Created pivot charts to visually represent trends, comparisons, and performance patterns.

Generated insights by identifying top-performing regions, customer segments, and product categories, along with underperforming areas.

Delivered a final interactive dashboard enabling stakeholders to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Insights

Total sales reached $2.64M with $249K profit, showing strong revenue performance.

The average profit margin of 10.86% indicates stable but improvable profitability.

Sales remain consistent across months, with a slight decline toward the end of the year suggesting seasonal slowdown.

Europe and LATAM are the top revenue-generating regions, while Africa shows the lowest contribution and growth potential.

The Consumer segment drives the highest revenue compared to Corporate and Home Office customers.

USA, France, and Mexico are leading countries in sales performance.

Cardio Equipment, Fishing, and Camping & Hiking are the best-performing product categories and main revenue drivers.

Categories like Toys, CDs, and Baby Products are underperforming and may require strategy improvements.

Monitoring shipping modes and order statuses helps improve operational efficiency and revenue realization.

Overall performance is stable, with opportunities in regional expansion, category optimization, and margin improvement.

## Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw ecommerce data can be transformed into meaningful business insights using Excel. The dashboard highlights key revenue drivers such as strong regions, customer segments, and high-performing product categories while also identifying underperforming areas. Overall, it supports data-driven decision-making by enabling performance tracking, profitability analysis, and growth opportunity identification.
