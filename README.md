# Ecommerce Sales Performance Dashboard – Excel Analytics Project
## Project Overview
I developed an interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze sales performance, profitability, customer segments, regional markets, and product category trends.
The dashboard converts raw transactional data into structured KPIs and visual insights to support business decision-making.

## Business Objective

The purpose of this project is to help stakeholders:

Monitor overall sales and profit performance

Identify top and underperforming product categories

Analyze customer segment contribution

Track regional market performance

Observe monthly sales trends and seasonality

## Dataset Used

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

What are the total sales, total profit, total number of orders, and overall profit margin?

How do sales change month by month, and are there any seasonal trends?

Which regions generate the highest and lowest revenue?

Which countries contribute most to overall sales?

Which customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) drives the most revenue?

What are the top-performing product categories?

Which product categories are underperforming and need improvement?

How do different shipping modes impact order distribution?

What is the status of orders (completed, cancelled, pending, etc.)?

Where should the business focus to improve sales, profit, and market growth?
